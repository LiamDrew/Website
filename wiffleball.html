    <!-- <h1>Wiffleball: America's Favorite Backyard Sport</h1>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Wiffleball</strong> is a variation of baseball designed for indoor or outdoor play in confined areas. The game is played using a perforated, light-weight, resilient plastic ball and a long, plastic bat.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Wiffleball was invented in 1953 by David N. Mullany in Fairfield, Connecticut. His 12-year-old son was having trouble hitting a curveball with a regular baseball, so Mullany designed a ball with holes that would curve naturally when thrown. The name "Wiffle" came from the family's slang for a strikeout - "a whiff."</p>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wiffle Ball:</strong> Lightweight plastic ball with 8 oblong holes on one side</li>
        <li><strong>Wiffle Bat:</strong> Lightweight plastic bat, typically yellow</li>
        <li><strong>Field:</strong> Can be played in backyards, parks, or even indoors</li>
        <li><strong>Bases:</strong> Simple markers or actual bases</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
    <p>Wiffleball follows similar rules to baseball but is adapted for smaller spaces:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Teams typically have 3-5 players</li>
        <li>Pitching distance is usually 20-30 feet</li>
        <li>Bases are placed closer together than in baseball</li>
        <li>The ball's unique design allows for impressive curveballs and sliders</li>
        <li>Games are usually shorter, often played to a certain number of runs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Wiffleball is Great</h2>
    <p>Wiffleball has remained popular for decades because it's:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> Anyone can play, regardless of age or skill level</li>
        <li><strong>Safe:</strong> The lightweight ball and bat make it safe for children</li>
        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Can be played almost anywhere with minimal setup</li>
        <li><strong>Fun:</strong> The unpredictable ball movement adds excitement</li>
        <li><strong>Social:</strong> Perfect for family gatherings and neighborhood games</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The Wiffle Ball Company still manufactures the official Wiffle Ball in Shelton, Connecticut, using the same design from 1953!</p>
    </div>
